    <h3>Description</h3>

    <p>I love a good Hawaiian Pizza! The sweet pineapples provide a nice flavor contrast to the savory flavors, and adds so much freshness to the pizza.</p>

    <h3>ingredients</h3>

    <ul>

        <li>Homemade pizza dough</li>
        <li>½ cup pizza sauce</li>
        <li>1 ½ to 2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>½ cup diced deli ham</li>
        <li>½ cup fresh diced pineapple, thoroughly patted dry</li>
        <li>ried oregano to taste</li>

    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>

    <ol>

        <li>If making your own pizza dough at home, make my pizza dough recipe until step 9. You only need one pizza dough ball for this recipe. You can also use store-bought dough, see note below.</li>
        <li>Make sure your oven is preheated at 475 degrees F.</li>
        <li>After you have brushed the dough with olive oil and pricked it with a fork (as directed in step 9 of my homemade pizza dough recipe), add the toppings. Start pizza sauce, then the cheese, ham, pineapple, and oregano. You can adjust the topping quantities, but don’t overfill it, as this can make the pizza soggy. Important: Thoroughly pat dry the pineapples before adding in order to prevent excess moisture.</li>
        <li>Make the melted butter by combining the melted butter with the garlic powder, oregano, and salt. Brush the borders with the melted garlic butter.</li>
        <li>Bake for 15 to 20 minutes, until bubbly and the edges are golden brown. Cut into 8 slices and serve.</li>
