    <h1>Filipino-Style Barbecue Chicken</h1>

    <h3>Description</h3>

    <p>I'm always hesitant filming a video that requires a special ingredient that might be difficult for the average food wisher to find at the local market. There's nothing more frustrating than getting all excited to try a new dish, only to find out you can't get one of the key ingredients, which in this case is banana ketchup. Do you have banana ketchup in your pantry? I didn't think so.

        But, as I joked about in the video, I remembered that I actually teach people how to cook things, so I decided to show a fast, easy version of this fabulous, fruity condiment, and I'm so glad I did. This was some truly great barbecue chicken, and I'm a little upset I didn't post it long ago. I remember getting a request for this stuff a while back, and taking a look at a recipe online, but after seeing the marinade needed "Filipino banana sauce," I think I moved on to something easier and more approachable.</p>

    <h3>ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
        <h5>For the Banana Ketchup:</h5>
        <li>1 medium very ripe banana, mashed</li>
        <li>¼ cup tomato paste</li>
        <li>¼ cup apple cider vinegar</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons brown sugar</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons vegetable oil</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons freshly grated ginger</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon onion powder</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon kosher salt, or to taste</li>
        <li>⅛ teaspoon ground allspice</li>
        <li>⅛ teaspoon ground turmeric</li>
        <li>¼ cup water</li>

        <h5>For the Chicken and Marinade:</h5>
        <li>½ cup prepared banana ketchup</li>
        <li>¾ cup lemon-lime soda (such as 7-Up®)</li>
        <li>½ cup soy sauce</li>
        <li>4 cloves crushed garlic</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons brown sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 medium lemon, juiced</li>
        <li>2½ pounds skinless, boneless chicken thighs, cut in half</li>

        <h5>For the Basting Sauce:</h5>
        <li>3 tablespoons reserved banana ketchup</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon brown sugar</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon fish sauce</li>
        
    </ul>

    <ol>
        <li>Mash ripe banana, tomato paste, vinegar, brown sugar, oil, ginger, onion powder, garlic powder, cayenne, salt, allspice, and turmeric together in a saucepan. Add water and stir to combine.</li>
        <li>Place over medium-high heat and bring to a simmer. Stir to combine. Reduce heat to medium and simmer until reduced and thickened, 7 to 10 minutes. Remove from heat; reserve 3 tablespoons for the basting sauce, leaving about 1/2 cup for the marinade.
        </li>
        <li>Transfer ½ cup banana ketchup to a bowl and add lemon-lime soda, soy sauce, garlic, brown sugar, black pepper, and lemon juice for the marinade. Whisk until combined. Add halved chicken thighs and toss to coat.
        </li>
        <li>Cover with plastic wrap and marinate in the refrigerator for 4 to 18 hours.
        </li>
        <li>When you are ready to cook the chicken, combine reserved 3 tablespoons banana ketchup, soy sauce, brown sugar, oil, and fish sauce in a small bowl for basting sauce.
        </li>
        <li>Preheat a charcoal grill until coals are very hot.
        </li>
        <li>Remove chicken from the refrigerator and place on metal skewers, folding in half with the smooth side on the outside, the rougher side folded in.
        </li>
        <li>Grill chicken over hot coals until no longer pink in the centers, 15 to 20 minutes, turning and basting every 2 to 3 minutes. Serve with accumulated juices or extra basting sauce.
